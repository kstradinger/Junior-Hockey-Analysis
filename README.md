# Junior-Hockey-Analysis
Working with 20 years of data from North American junior hockey leagues (USHL, OHL, QMJHL, WHL) this project analyzes features of players who do and don't make it to the NHL. I also hope to use machine learning methods to train a model to predict whether or not a player will make it to the NHL level given their stats in their respective junior league.
